Hi, my name is Wei Liu (刘威). Currently, I am a final-year graduate student at ShanghaiTech University, advised by Prof. [Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). I am also an incoming PhD at [HKUST NLP](https://github.com/hkust-nlp), supervised by Prof. [Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/). 

I am focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

To be more specific, my research interests lie in:
  - **Efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Enhancing efficiency in training, inference, and handling long-range scenarios for Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Explorations of the emergent capabilities and applications in complex scenarios.
  - **Structured Predictions**: Parsing and application of parsing algorithm in downstream tasks. 
  - **Deep Generative Models**: Deep Latent-variable models.

# News
  - \[12/2023\] Our [Deita](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/deita) (**D**ata-**E**fficient **I**nstruction **T**uning for **A**lignment) Project has been released! Utilizing only **6K** samples of SFT data selected by Deita, along with **10K** randomly selected preference data, our Deita-7B model has achieved remarkable results, scoring **7.55** on the MT-Bench benchmark, **90.06%** on AlpacaEval, and **69.86** on the OpenLLM Benchmark!
