Hi, my name is Wei Liu (ÂàòÂ®Å). Currently, I am a second-year graduate student at ShanghaiTech University, advised by Prof. [KeWei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). I am focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

To be more specific, my research interests lie in:
  - **Efficient Sequence Modeling**: Exploring more efficient model architecture, particularly for long-range sequence.
  - **Structured Predictions**: Parsing and application of parsing algorithm in downstream tasks.
  - **Deep Generative Models**: Deep Latent-variable models.
  - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Explorations of their Emergent Capabilities and Applications in Complex Scenarios.
