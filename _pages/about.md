Hi, my name is Wei Liu (ÂàòÂ®Å). Currently, I am a second-year graduate student at ShanghaiTech University, advised by Prof. [KeWei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). I am focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

To be more specific, my research interests lie in:
  - **Structured prediction** (parsing, application of parsing algorithm to downstream tasks)
  - **Few-shot Learning** (application of PLMs/LLMs to zero/few-shot scenario)
  - **Efficient sequence modeling**
  - **Knowledge-enhanced NLP**
